# Escape-From-CS-162-Game
Program in C++ that runs a maze game. The user will guide the intrepid student
in an attempt to escape from the CS 162 class. They must pick up programming skills
along the way and cannot be caught by any of the TAs. If they reach the instructor
with the correct number of skills, the intrepid student gets a passing grade, and the 
user wins. There is currently a bug in the game where the TAs do not move beginning
after the second turn, and a possibility of the game crashing when two TAs land on the
same space. I plan to fix this in time later.
